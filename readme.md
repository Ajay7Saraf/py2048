# Game 2048

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game.
The object of the game is to combine the numbers displayed on the tiles until you reach 2048.To run this you will need python

# Description

When you start the game, there will be two “tiles” on the grid, each displaying the number 2. You hit the (w,a,s and d) keys on your keyboard to move the tiles around — and also to generate new tiles, which will also be valued at 2. When two equal tiles collide, they combine to give you one greater tile that displays their sum. The more you do this, obviously, the higher the tiles get and the more crowded the board becomes. Your objective is to reach 2048 or winning tile you entered before the board fills up.
